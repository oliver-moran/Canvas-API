Canvas API is a library for developing rich web content using JavaScript¨ (ECMAScript) and the HTML5 canvas tag.

The functionality offered by the library is comparable to applications such as Adobe¨ Flash¨, including:

* Images (GIF, PNG, JPEG, SVG, etc.), audio (MP3, OGG, etc.) and video support (MPEG, MOV, OGG, etc.).
* Geometric shapes (lines, rectangles, polygons, circles, BŽzier curves, arcs).
* Text (outline and filled), including fonts imported via CSS.
* Shadows, alpha blending, fill gradients (liner and gradient) and patterns.
* Grouping, layering and masking of drawings, images, video and text.
* Matrix transformation of all objects and groups of objects (translation, rotation, skew, scale).
* Baked in animations and tweening with multiple effects and frame event callbacks (such as `onDraw` and `onBeforeDraw`).
* Mouse and touch events on all objects (such as `onPress` or `onRelease`), drag and drop support and key press events.
* Copy, paste and saving of canvas images as files.
* Built-in support for the Pixastic image effects library by default (blur, sepia, invert, etc.) or other user-definable image effects libraries.

Canvas API uses only expected HTML5 standard JavaScript[2] W3C¨ and is supported by the latest versions of:

* Firefox¨
* Safari¨ (including iPhone¨)
* Chrome¨
* Android¨
* Opera¨
* Camino¨ (excluding text, video and audio functions)

Canvas API is also supported by the beta version of Internet Explorer¨ 9 and works on Windows¨, Mac¨, Linux¨, iPhone¨ and Android¨ as well as other PCs and mobile devices. 

Because Canvas API is standards compliant it does not require any plug-ins to work.
