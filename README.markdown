Canvas API is a library for developing rich web content using the HTML5 canvas tag.

The functionality offered by the library is comparable to applications such as Adobe¨ Flash¨, including:

* Images (GIF, PNG, JPEG, SVG, etc.), audio (MP3, OGG, etc.) and video support (OGG, MPEG, MOV, etc.).
* Geometric shapes (lines, rectangles, polygons, circles, BŽzier curves, arcs).
* Text (outline and filled), including fonts imported via CSS.
* Shadows, alpha blending, fill gradients (liner and gradient) and patterns.
* Grouping, layering and masking of drawings, images, video and text.
* Matrix transformation on all objects or groups of objects (translation, rotation, skew, scale).
* Tweened animations with multiple effects and frame event callbacks (such as `onDraw` and `onBeforeDraw`).
* Mouse and touch events (such as `onClick` or `onRelease`).

Canvas API uses only expected HTML5 standard JavaScript[1] and is supported by the latest versions of:

* Firefox
* Safari (including iPhone)
* Camino (excluding text rendering function)
* Opera
* Android

Canvas API is also supported by the beta version of Internet Explorer 9.

Because Canvas API is standard's compliant it does not require any plug-ins to work.
